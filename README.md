# proj12
Simple bot which can be integrated into any platform depending on the data trained

To add more training data edit the **intents.json** file and add as much as you want..... 
The **intents.json** acts as a dictionary for the bot

run the **main.py** file first after adding data to the dictionary to train the bot before running the **chatbot.py** file...

Pickle files and model files would be created in the process of training the bot
